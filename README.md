# SQL-Based Security Log Analysis for Incident Investigation

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of SQL to analyze authentication logs and identify potential security incidents. The focus is on detecting suspicious login behavior commonly investigated in SOC environments.

## Tech Stack
- SQL
- Relational Database (authentication log data)

## Key Use Cases
- Identified repeated failed login attempts
- Detected after-hours access activity
- Flagged logins from non-approved geographic regions

## What I Learned
- Writing targeted SQL queries for security log analysis
- Identifying indicators of compromise in authentication data
- Applying SQL to real-world SOC-style incident investigations
